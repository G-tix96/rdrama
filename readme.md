This code runs https://rdrama.net, https://pcmemes.net and https://watchpeopledie.co

# Installation (Windows/Linux/MacOS)

1- Install Docker on your machine.

[Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2- Run the following commands in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Aevann1/rDrama/

cd rDrama

docker-compose up
```

3- That's it! Visit `localhost` in your browser and make an account (the first account to be made will have full admin rights)

4- Optional: to change the domain from "localhost" to something else and configure the site settings, as well as integrate it with the external services the website uses, edit the variables in the `env` file and then restart the docker container.


------

For returning contributors, we have noticed the following issues (if you can help fix them, we will be very grateful!):

1. Docker doesn't know when we add a new Python dependency, `docker-compose build` is needed.
2. DB schema changes are not applied automatically, the easiest way to deal with that is to delete the entire environment from the Docker GUI and do `docker-compose up`. Also wait five minutes for a "sneed" commit from Aevann meaning that the sql file was regenerated.
